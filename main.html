            Note: You may had notice I am using iframes<br />
            Yes I do have code to resize the iframes when you click on a nav bar link<br />
            for some reason you need to double click on a nav bar link for the code that resize it to work<br />
            Should it just do it correctly when you click on a nav link the first time, yes it should<br />
            but it just dont, and Im not sure how or why it dont.

            <br />
