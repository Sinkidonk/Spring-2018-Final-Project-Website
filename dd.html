        <p>Now DD is a low-level format tool, it, in fact, a little powerful than just a format tool, where you replace all data, with 0 while you can do that it as simple as doing.</p>
        <code>
            <mark>dd</mark> if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
        </code>
        <p>
            Where /dev/zero is a file that has only 0 bites, and /dev/sda is the USB/hard drive you want to format.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now how do you make sure you're formatting the right hard drive. You use Fdisk -l and look for the info you need. <br>
            From there you can use the dd command to format.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now let say you wanted to make a low-level backup of a USB/hard drive yes you can do that with dd.
        </p>

        <code><mark>dd</mark> if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/keep/file.img bs=1M conv=notrunc,noerror</code>

        <p>
            Now what this did was take /dev/sda and at 1mb at a time is putting it all into an img file.<br>
            The notrunc tell it to not cut out the output at the end, and noerror tell it to run even if the hard drive has i/o error.
