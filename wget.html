            Now this is a good one it a powerful download manager,<br>
            you can download files, you could mirror a whole website<br>
            if you wanted. Now this command have a lot of used and I will<br>
            only cover two of the used.
        </p>

        <code>
            <mark>wget</mark> www.website.com/filetodl.zip
        </code>
        <p>
            Now what this is doing is the basic download manager for<br>
            use wget is the command and what come after it is what your<br>
            telling it to download.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now I'm going to talk about the mirror options which I use it for more then often for.
        </p>

        <code>
            <mark>wget</mark> -m http://kronos.gtc.edu/~aparys/
        </code>
        <p>
            Now let look at what it doing there the -m option enable and that<br>
            enable option -N -r -l inf --no-remove-listing now each options<br>
            have it use -N just make sure if you already have the file it don't re-download it<br>
            -r is recursive download mode so wget will go to each and every link<br>
            and download each file in every link and so on until there are no more<br>
            links to follow. -l inf just tell -r how many links to go down.<br>
        </p>
