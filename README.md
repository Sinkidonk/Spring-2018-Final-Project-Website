# Spring 2018 Final Project Website
 I created this website as a final project for two of my classes together.
 Javascript and Web Programming Two. It is kind of messsy as I tried using iframes to create
 the site also because of the requirements to I needed to meet for both classes.
 In retrospect working with iframes and responsive design didn't work well together.
