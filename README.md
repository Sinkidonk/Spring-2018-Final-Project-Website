# Spring 2018 Final Project Website
 I created this website as a final project for two of my classes together.
 Javascript and Web Programming Two. It is kind of messsy as I tried using iframes to create
 the site also because of the requirements to I needed to meet for both classes.
 In retrospect working with iframes and responsive design didn't work well together.
 Looking at it now I guess iframes and responsive design was just underdeveloped at the time.
 I tested it now and everything just works as I orignally expected it too.
 It still a little weird with the border not looking nice on all pages unfortunately.
 That is just my own error.
