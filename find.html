            Now find is a command line utility that searches one or more directory trees<br>
            of a file system, it can locate files and I'll be talking about some of the used for it.<br>
        </p>
        <code>
            <mark>find</mark> . -name 'file*' -type f
        </code>
        <p>
            Now this tell the find command to look in the directory it is in as show by<br>
            the . the -name 'file*' tell it to look for any file that starts with the name of a file, and the -type f just tell it we are only looking for files.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now for my favorite used of it is deleting the empty folder.
        </p>
        <code>
            <mark>find</mark> . -type d -empty -delete
        </code>
        <p>
            Now what we are doing here we have the . that show the directory you're in<br>
            -type d tell the command to only look for folders, and -empty tell it to only<br>
            look for empty folders, and then the -delete tells it to delete every file it finds.
        </p>
